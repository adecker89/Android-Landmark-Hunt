This application was written for a game with the ofllowing formula:
	1. Teams are sent to find local landmarks as fast as they can.
	2. The application provides hints to find the location and uses GPS to determine when they've reached it.

The landmark hunt is customizable through editing the destinations.xml file located in res/xml folder.
